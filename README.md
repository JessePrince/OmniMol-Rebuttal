# Supplementary information for rebuttal

Due to **severe character limit**, we are not able to provide all of the results in OpenReview. To further address your concern, we have included detailed responses and experimental results in separate `markdown` file named after the reviewer name. 

- You can see the complete results of **``evidence of gradient conflict"**, **``comparison of different backbone"** in `reviewer_QVuL.md`.

- You can see the complete results of **wet lab data and classification results**, **comparison with RDKit**, **IUPAC name identification** in `reviewer_UEAu.md`. Besides, all of the responses on OpenReview for reviewer UEAu are truncated, here, we provide the original detailed responses.
